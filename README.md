Welcome to the freeCodeCampOxford website repository. If you would like to contribute, and you know what you're doing - go for it and thank you, looking forward to your PRs. 

Are you familiar with Git? If the answer is yes - great, skip over the next paragraph. 

If for you git means 'an unpleasant or contemptible person', then you probably should get used to an idea that we use English words in a very strange way. And for us Git is a tool we use to work together (yeah, it's a strange name, but we know you love your trivia, so 
[here is why it has such a strange name](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Git-called-Git), the last part is so true, though). 
If you're just starting out, learning Git is one of the most useful things you can learn in your coding journey. [Let's go and learn it.](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)


Next, [fork a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and run it your local machine. 
You can google ```live server``` for your text editor, on how to do that. 

Here are the most popular ones: 
 - [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) 
 - [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server)
 - [Sublime Text 3](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LiveReload)
 
As you've started everything up and it runs, create a separate branch for your feature.

```
git checkout -b my-super-awesome-feature
```

Code away and remember:

When you finish with ```my-super-awesome-feature```
submit a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) (aka PR)

Please answer the questions which appear when you submit your PR honestly and feel free to go back over your code and change it to make sure it fulfils the requirements. We massively respect your time creating ```my-super-awesome-feature```, but if it's challenging to review it, you won't see the fruits of your work for longer than it should have been. 

Happy Coding!
